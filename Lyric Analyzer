And holding it tight Emotional touch Touching my skin And askin' you to do 
What you've been doing All over again Oh it's a beautiful thing 
Don't think I can keep it all in I just gotta let you know What it is that won't let me go Its your love 
It just does something to me It sends a shock right through me I can't get enough And if you wonder 
About the spell I'm under Oh its your love Better than I was More than I am 
And all of this happened By taking your hand And who I am now Is who I wanted to be 
And now that we're together I'm stronger than ever, I'm happy and free"""
